    <h2>Understanding UPI & Banking Errors</h2>

    <p>UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has revolutionized digital payments in India, enabling instant money transfers
        between bank accounts. However, with over 10 billion monthly transactions, errors are common. When a transaction
        fails, you typically see cryptic error codes like U28, U30, or XH – but what do they actually mean?</p>

    <p>UPI errors occur for various reasons: insufficient funds, exceeded transaction limits, bank server downtime,
        incorrect UPI IDs, or security blocks. Each error code corresponds to a specific issue identified by NPCI
        (National Payments Corporation of India) or your bank. Understanding these codes helps you take the right action
        quickly – whether that's waiting for a limit reset, checking your balance, or contacting your bank.</p>

    <p>This free tool explains UPI and banking errors in plain English. Simply enter your error code or paste the full
        error message, and we'll tell you exactly what went wrong, why it happened, and what you should do next. No
        technical jargon, no confusion – just clear answers.</p>
